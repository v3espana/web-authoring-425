	<h2 id="sec1">Why I'm Documenting My Trash Every Week</h2>
	
	<p>Choosing to record my trash was a simple decision, one guided by my urge to declutter my room. The hard part came when it was time to decide which items were the ones to go. You would think it would be easy– that trash is trash. At first, it was. I threw away the empty water bottles and chip bags, all of the actual trash. Week 3 was when it got hard, and I had started to be extremely mindful about what I considered for disposal.</p>
	
	<p>Waste is a form of self-reflection. As I became more deliberate about what I chose to throw away, I realized that my trash revealed patterns about my habits, routines, and values. Items I hesitated to discard made me question why I was holding onto them in the first place. What value did these seemingly useless items bring to me?</p>
	
	<p>By being more mindful of my discarding habits, I was forced to slow down and acknowledge my relationship with overconsumption. What began as a practical effort to clean my messy dorm room <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/news/a43965/messy-people-are-officially-more-intelligent/">(which supposedly means I'm more intelligent)</a> became an exercise in material awareness, revealing how important my choices around waste are.</p>
	
	<h3>Background</h3>
	
	<p>I was first introduced to Trash of the Week in my Web Authoring class at Rutgers with Professor Jonathan Bass. In class, I was given two readings, the first being a <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash">Sara Newman article</a>, which consults the history of waste and how trash is seen as a modern phenomenon. Next, I read an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html">article by Vik Muniz</a>, who took trash and turned it into art. What started as a trivial assignment has become a new lifestyle for me, inspired by Greg Segall's <a href = "https://phmuseum.com/projects/7-days-of-garbage">7 Days of Garbage</a>. And after reading this, I hope you too can take major steps into seeing trash in a new light!</p>

	<h2 id="sec2">Weekly Overview</h2>
	
	<p>This week, I found myself struggling to determine what I considered trash. Though I value a lot of the items that I am throwing away, I needed to consider their purpose. Do these items still serve me? Why am I still holding onto them? Maybe it is time to no longer live in the past and get rid of some things that I have been so desperately clinging to for so many years. Therefore, I decided to take a big step and change the way I approached this. It was no longer about just cleaning my room (p.s. Marie Kondo's <a href = "https://konmari.com/how-to-fold-clothes/?srsltid=AfmBOoohJpyUyLBq852mWACIJzdfwkajcAAkaVaxXZSWSIYBkeew80pE">clothes folding method</a> is the best way to clean your closet), but about being mindful of the things that I had and knowing when to let go.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>It Broke, Get Rid of It</h3>
	
	<p>This group of items includes all of the items that I have zero use for. The items are as follows: a broken chain, an old pair of glasses, and a broken charger. I got the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery_chain">chain</a> in a three-pack from Amazon. I still use one of them, lost the other, and this one broke during one of my dance practices. For some reason, it has been sitting with the rest of my jewelry this whole time. As for the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses">glasses</a>, I used to use them when I couldn’t find the pair I currently use… until I didn't notice them on the floor next to my dresser. I crushed them under my foot, and now they do not sit on my face correctly. Lastly, my mom gave me a computer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C">USB-C charger</a> to replace my other one, but lo and behold, the one she gave me didn’t work at all. So, I might as well get rid of all these things, since I don’t use them anyway!</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<h3>Trip Down Memory Lane</h3>
	
	<p>Next, I decided to get rid of some trinkets and mementos that were taking up unnecessary space. These items include: LEGO instructions, an empty bottle of cologne, a duplicate Smiski, and a Rubik’s Cube. I got the Miles Morales <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Spider-Man">Spider-Man LEGO</a> set for my birthday from my sister and her boyfriend. I built the LEGOs, but no longer have a use for the instructions. I got rid of my other instructions, including the Infinity Gauntlet, the Iron Spider-Man, and Peter Parker's mask, so I should do the same with this one. I got the <a href="https://www.wikiparfum.com/en/fragrances/wood-sage-sea-salt"> Jo Malone Wood Sage and Sea Salt cologne</a> from my friends as a housewarming, and a year later, I’ve used it up. I recently replaced it with another fragrance, and no longer need the bottle. Third, I pulled a duplicate of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiski">Smiski</a> that I already had, and I’ve kept it just for the fun of things. After considering it further, someone else would definitely house it better. The last item in this group is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube">Rubik’s Cube</a> I got as a kid. It has become a decoration, as it lacks the smoothness it used to have. Parting with these items definitely hit the nostalgia factor, but I do want to grow up a little bit.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<h3>Old and Worn</h3>
	
	<p>The last group of items includes some old clothes that sit at the back of my closet. One of the items is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanes">Hanes</a> white T-shirt. I’ve had this shirt for years, and it was deemed a “sleep only” shirt about two years ago. I don’t even use it for sleep anymore! The other is a black <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necktie">tie</a> from H&#38;M. I’ve had it since my sophomore year of high school, but I haven’t used it in a few years. I got a nicer tie, so this one hides at the bottom of my accessories. These items have definitely served their purpose, and it’s time to let go of them.</p>

	<h2 id="sec4">Until Next Week...</h2>
	
	<p>Thank you again for coming back each week to see what new trash I’m getting rid of! Though I threw away things that no longer served me, it was upsetting to let go of things I’d cherished for so long. But, I do think that it is time to grow up. I hope you continue to learn from this, just as much as I do, and I’m excited to see what’s in store for next week! In the meantime, I'm going to continue watching <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/white-lotus/14f9834d-bc23-41a8-ab61-5c8abdbea505">The White Lotus</a>. Have a good one, see you soon!</p>
